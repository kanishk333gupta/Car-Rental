## Formulas to be used

1 . For Amount

t = Total time a car is used (mins)
r = total km it's running
Booking amount = Paid at initial (Depends on type of car)

Amount depends on t,r
Due amount = Amount to be paid after completion
Due amount = t X Rs.1 + r X Rs.10

Maintenance charge = Depends on type of damage
Total amount to be paid at end = Maintenance charge + ( Due amount - Booking amount )
Total amount paid by customer = Total amount to be paid at end + booking amount
